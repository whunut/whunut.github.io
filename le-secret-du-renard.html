	  <p>Farewell, said the fox. Here is my secret. It is very
		   simple: we only see cleary with the heart. The essential
		   is invisible to the eyes.</p>
		<p>The essential is invisible to the eyes, repeated the little
		   prince, in order that he remember.</p>
		<p>It is the time you spend with your rose that makes your rose
		   so important.</p>
		<p>It is the time that I spend with my rose...said the little
			 prince, in order that he remember.</p>
		<p>Men have forgotten this truth, said the fox. But you must not
			 forget it. You muse become responsible always of what you have
			 tamed. You are responsible for the rose...</p>
		<p>I am responsible for my rose...repeated the little prince,
		in order that he remember.</p>
